# Weaver

Lightweight game framework that is a replacement for [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit).

Almost the same, just without the use of external libraries; no promises or any extra packages to install.

All code is up-to-date with the latest technology in Roblox, including Luau typechecking.
