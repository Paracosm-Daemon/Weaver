# Weaver

Weaver is a lightweight game framework meant for simple yet seamless game networking and synchronization. Weaver adheres by a single-script architecture, with a setup for the creation of services and controllers, allowing quick, painless communication from script-to-script, without the need of BindableEvents/Functions.

This was originally developed as a replacement for [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit), but without the use of external libraries; there are no promises or extra packages to install, as all modules are packaged internally and created for Weaver.

All code is up-to-date with the latest technology in Roblox, including Luau typechecking.
