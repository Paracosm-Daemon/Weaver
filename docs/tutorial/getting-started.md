# Getting Started

As of right now, Weaver is currently available on the Roblox Creator Store, and it is useable as a Wally package. Below are the current ways to install Weaver and get it working in your game.

## Installation

### Method 1 - Wally

Since Weaver is available as a package for [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally), the package manager, you are able to install it by adding this beneath `[dependencies]` in your `wally.toml` file:

`Weaver = "paracosm-daemon/weaver@^0.0.1"`

### Method 2 - Roblox Creator Store

Weaver is also available as a module on the Roblox Creator Store. Installing it is relatively simple.

First, [get the model](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/18772004646/Weaver). To add it to your inventory, you simply click the "Get Model" button.

Once you've acquired the model, you're free to add it into Studio. You should see it within your inventory:

Finally, insert the model into your game, and then slot it somewhere you can easily access. Usually, it may go in a folder like `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Weaver`, but it's up to you.
